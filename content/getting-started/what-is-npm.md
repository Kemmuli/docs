# What is npm?

npm, the package manager for JavaScript, opens up an entire world of JavaScript talent to you and your team. To find code you need, search npm's registry of 600,000 JavaScript _packages_, (building blocks of code) uploaded by open-source developers from across the planet, or down the street. Typically, developers create a small building block of code that solves one problem well, then "package" the code into a directory that follows npm guidelines. A typical application, such as a website, will consist of dozens or hundreds of small packages.

Approximately 3 billion npm packages are downloaded per week. 
  
npm makes it possible for developers to draw on the expertise of people who have solved particular problems, whether in your organization, or outside of it. By building on code that already exists, npm helps your team focus on bringing your project forward, faster, instead of losing time solving problems someone else solved last week. npm helps your team work together better, sharing developer talent across projects, and managing multiple versions of code.
  
To find packages, browse the npm [website](https://www.npmjs.com). If you are a developer working alone, you can find code written by others interested in the same problem space. If you are part of an existing organization, use npm to help your team work together better   

While browsing, you'll find lots of Node modules, which can be used on the server side. There are also many packages which add commands for you to use in the command line. And there are an ever-increasing amount of packages that can be used on the front end. (To understand the difference between node modules and packages, click [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/packages)).
 
npm consists of three distinct components: 
 
*  the website
*  the registry
*  the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The [*website*](https://npmjs.com) is the primary way developers discover packages, set up profiles, and manage other aspects of their npm experience.

The *registry* is a large database of information about packages.

The [*CLI*](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm), run from a terminal, is how developers publish their packages on the registry or download packages they wish to install.

## Things You Can Do 

* Adapt packages to your apps, or incorporate them as they are. 

* Download standalone tools to use right away. 

* Run packages without downloading using [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx). 

* Share code with any npm user, any where, or restrict code to specific developers. 

* Form virtual teams (orgs). 

* Manage multiple versions of code and code dependencies.

* Update applications easily when underlying code is updated.

## How to Find Packages
  
To find packages, browse the npm [website](https://www.npmjs.com). 

While browsing, you'll find:

*  lots of Node modules, which can be used on the server side. 
*  packages, which add commands for you to use in the command line. 
*  an ever-increasing amount of packages that can be used on the front end of websites.

## Example: Finding a Package

For example, suppose you wanted to use bar codes (QR codes) in your application. Rather than spend weeks figuring out how to do this, why not see if someone has posted a package that creates QR codes? Start by entering a value in the search bar:

![blanksearchbar](/images/search-bar-qr-scanner-what-is-npm.png)

Related options will appear:

![choicessearchbar](/images/search-results-qr-what-is-npm.png)

Or, if you click, you will have a chance to filter the possibilities even more:

![filtersearchbar](/images/search-qr-what-is-npm.png)

When you choose a package to explore, more information appears. This information is written by the package author(s) so details vary. 

![searchresults](/images/page-results-qr-scanner-what-is-npm.png)

Now, you can read the developer's instructions to discover how to use this package. 

## Next Steps

Now that you know what npm is, and a bit about how to use it, it's time to get started.  [Install npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). We look forward to seeing what you will create!
